 unzip or clone the specific file like "client", in terminal type "npm install". After that type "npm run dev" to start the project locally on pc. Although there's a bakend part here. I hoisted the backend code on render. So, if you run client side on pc it's automatically got data from backend code that hoisted on internet.
